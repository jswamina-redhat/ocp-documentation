# Purpose
This document outlines how to access an OpenShift node for various tasks such as debugging.

# Accessing OCP Nodes

The best practice method for accessing OpenShift node is using oc debug, for example:

```
oc debug node/<node_name>
```

Alternatively, one can SSH into the OpenShift node from the bastion host. The SSH private keys are stored on the bastion host at `~$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519`.

Note that SSH keys are generated by Ansible during the cluster deployment and are unique for each OpenShift cluster. We planned to store a copy of the SSH key in HashiCorp Vault but this was not implemented.

If the SSH private key is lost, the authorized SSH keys can be updated on the cluster after the installation. Refer to Solution 3868301: How to update ssh keys after installation in Openshift 4?

As a last resort, it is possible to break into the OpenShift node by booting it into a single user mode. This requires adding single to the kernel command-line, see also Solution 5500131: How to start Red Hat CoreOS (RHCOS) in emergency mode in OpenShift Container Platform 4.
